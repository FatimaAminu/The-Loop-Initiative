            My message this morning is very simple!

            Before you conclude that things will never get better,please remember the men and women whose success story is beyond human 
            comprehension. People’s whose background was not encouraging at all,people who had failed severally but never gave up…
            
            A lot of people you do not know or have personal relationship with are currently going through difficult times. They are frustrated,
             confuse and almost giving up…
            
            What happen to those who could not read this post now? Well, the good news for some one reading this right now is that 
            YOU WILL RISE ABOVE YOUR DIFFICULT SITUATION. YOU WILL BE MOTIVATED 
            
            and YOU WILL BE MORE so others who are going through similar odd will be motivated to do more!!!
            
            Remember, I need you to join us #theloopinitiative #Beskilled #beempowered.
          Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, 
          creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises,
           including through access to financial services.

       </p>

        <p>

           with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value .Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
            , substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training.Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate 
             unemployment.
        </p>
        <p>Every one is essentially the character of his or her thoughts and that explains why people differ in their behavior.
           As a man thinks in his heart, so is he. In other words, you’re not different from the way you think. Through months
            and years of continuously thinking in a certain way, your mind becomes programmed in that direction, and that’s the 
            direction your life will go.

            Every thing you can see today started from what you desire-what you thought. Your thought is a unique product of
            your creation. Creation must first of all start from thinking; thinking of what to create, how to create it and
           when to create it. Simply put, you create things by merely thinking about it. The truth is, you are your 
            thoughts, positively or negatively. Your thought rules you. When you allow the right thoughts to dwell and envelop your mind, that’s what will make you a success in all ramifications of life.
            
            I dare you to think differently, Act differently and be differently different!</p>
