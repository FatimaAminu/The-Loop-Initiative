        <p>
            Life is tough in Makoko, a sprawling slum of some 100,000 inhabitants, that is built on stilts into the putrid waters of Lagos Lagoon in Nigeria
            The fish in the lagoon are dying, there is no electricity or running water and raw sewage laps at the floors of many dwellings. Yet these concerns pale into insignificance in the face of the greatest threat to this 200 year old community — the threat of eviction.
          Makoko faces immense challenges. The government services are very limited. This reflects a complete lack
          of governance or political interest in the community. Community issues are addressed by the Baale-the Chief
          and most respected person in Makoko. The people's concern relates primarily to poverty, crime, unemployment,
          and the need for small-scale businesses.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          Chiefs and parents were mainly concerned about the high rate of teenage pregnancy and anti-social activities
          of 'area boys' (small gangs, formed by young men who drop out of school and misuse alcohol and drugs). On the 
          other hand, the young people were concerned about their parents' inability to provide resources for their education, 
          parental unemployment, and the unsanitary and cramped conditions in which they lived. Young people often expressed 
          a feeling of unhappiness.
        </p>

        <p>
          In response to these concerns, several organizations and foundations, in collaboration with the Makoko community, 
          offer different community programs. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The Loop Initiative</strong>  is an organization that has taken it upon themselves to wipe away the tears of members 
          of Makoko Community, by providng solution to the issue of Unemployment.
