          <p> The Loop Initiative is aimed at driving youth creativity, 
              innovation and enterprise through the means of institutionalized engagements in tertiary institutions 
              and support programs for graduates, artisans and the less privileged of the society across Nigeria 
              in particular and Africa in general.</p>
    
     
    
            <p>This foundation aims at reducing youth unemployment in Nigeria & Africa by creating an empowerment platform. This is in 
            recognition of the widely accepted fact that Africa Youth is gifted, talented and endowed with creativity
            but with little or no effort to enhance them. </p>

            <p>Founded in June 2019, we recognize that there are severe shortcomings in the employment sector in Africa and in this area, seek to improve the lives of Africans.

                We provide educational conferences, create learning spaces and provide skill acquisition training to support for indigent communities.
                
                <p> This is achieved by collaborating with the private sector, individuals and other developmental agencies towards building a resourceful and sustainable network to secure employment opportunities for members of a particular community. Subsequently building a network of socially responsible youths with a mindset oriented towards achieving social development.
                
                </p>Our activities range from providing educational opportunities, building learning spaces, implementing mentorship programs, engaging with policymakers, advocating, promoting volunteerism, developing the communities and celebrating the humanity of every child we are privileged to support.
                
                Loop Initiative currently operates in Lagos State with Makoko community being its first project. There are plans to expand to other parts of Lagos, Nigeria and Africa.
